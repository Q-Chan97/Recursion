# Recursion

This project is meant to showcase my understanding of recursive logic by writing three functions. Two are to display the number of steps in the fibonacci sequence, both recursively and iteratively. The third is a merge and sort function that sorts arrays of integers numerically using a divide and conquer strategy.
